# cmu-mocap

This is a copy of the CMU mocap dataset in bvh format, as ported by Bruce Hahne and made available at https://sites.google.com/a/cgspeed.com/cgspeed/motion-capture/cmu-bvh-conversion

### Why?

I just though it would be quite convenient to have the data available through http requests on github.

### Can I use this data?

AFAIK, yes. Check `READMEFIRST.txt` for the actual text where both CMU and Bruce (the person that ported these sequences) say that you can do whatever you want with the data.
